// This plugin is a project being developed as part of the Rune Synth system and is in active development. Feel free to reach out to me at www.runesynth.com if you would more information about this or any of the other synth projects that I am developing. This is the first public facing project I am releasing but have several others in various states of development behind the scenes to be released at a later date! Stay tuned for more!

# OpenAmbience
OpenAmbience JSFX plugin is designed to create organic and beautiful ambient soundscapes using various midi algorithms and musical wizardry. It is the first 'Rune' being released by Rune Synth and will work in tandem with other Rune projects as they are released in the coming years. 

# Compatibility 
Currently, OpenAmbience is being developed with Reapers JSFX development system in mind but could potentially be opened up to additional languages and suites in the future.
